#**Framework 1.0 Instructions**
this is the first version of my php framework,it's simple.And it can't be used in your job.:)

it's a demo,I write it just for learning how to use other PHP framworks,like lavaral,TP.I want to know more about framework.

##**Table Of Contents**
+ app
    + admin
      + controller
        + index.php
+ system
    + constant.php
    + function.php
    + url.php
+ index.php

we have three parts,app(inlcude all application files),system(framwork environment files) and index.php(it's gate)

##**Why Write This**
it's a good try,and i do think it's helpful if you like me want to know more about how framework was built and why.Build one by yourself is a best way,and this is one example.hope helpful.
